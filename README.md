# hardware_comms
A class-based implementation of different types of lab devices, including:
- Spectrometers
- Linear Motors
- more to come!

Each types of devices has an interface, and every device provides
a unique implementation of the same methods. This allows
for easy re-use of existing code bases with different hardware.
